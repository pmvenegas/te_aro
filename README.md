# Te Aro ActiveRecordObserver

Designed to help with understanding how a particular block of code changes your `ActiveRecord` objects. See what gets changed, what type of objects are created, and what the values on those objects are. It can also display the sequence of callbacks that was triggered.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'te_aro'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install te_aro

## Usage

```ruby
# With defaults:
TeAro::Observer.new.observe { @some_ar_object.do_something_that_triggers_callbacks }

# With the tracer enabled (slow):
TeAro::Observer.new(tracer: true).observe { @some_ar_object.do_something_that_triggers_callbacks }

# Can also use the Kernel#aro method to call with defaults:
aro { @some_ar_object.do_something }
```

## Sample Session

Te Aro in action on gitlab code:

```ruby
# gitlab-development-kit/gitlab/spec/services/merge_requests/create_service_spec.rb
      # ...
      before do
        project.team << [user, :master]
        project.team << [assignee, :developer]
        allow(service).to receive(:execute_hooks)

        aro { @merge_request = service.execute }
      end
      # ...
```

Run:
```
$ bundle exec rspec spec/services/merge_requests/create_service_spec.rb -fd
```

Output in `log/te_aro.log`:
```

```

### Output

By default, output is logged to `log/te_aro.log`. This can be changed by passing a `Logger` instance when constructing the observer.

Eg to log to STDOUT:
```ruby
TeAro::Observer.new(logger: Logger.new(STDOUT)).observe { some_ar_object.do_something }
```


### Options

Options are passed as a hash to `Observer.new`.

The following options are available:

* `:tracer` Show the ActiveRecord callbacks that were called. A truthy value will turn this on, it is off by default
* `:tracker` Show ActiveRecord objects that have been created or changed. A falsey value will turn this off. On by default.
* `:logger` Sets the logger used to record output.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
